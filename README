== U2F for Wordpress

NOTE: Development of this plugin has been (at least temporarily) discontinued since https://github.com/shield-9/u2f-login[a more complete plugin] has appeared.

This plugin adds support for the two factor authentication standard U2F.

The functionality is similar to the U2F (Security Key) support available for Google accounts:

* Users registers U2F devices themselves.
* Users are not required to register devices.
* A user can have multiple devices registered.
* Currently, only Google Chrome is supported.


=== Installation

. Install the dependencies using http://getcomposer.org[Composer].
. Move the wordpress-u2f directory into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
. Go to _Settings_ -> _U2F_.
. Set https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/App_ID.html[App ID] to the the base URL of your website, for example _https://mysite.wordpress.com_.

=== Managing devices
U2F devices can be added and removed from the profile screen (accessible by clicking on your name at the top of the screen).
